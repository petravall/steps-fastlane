  Runs your fastlane lane.

  If `Gemfile` exists in the `work_dir` directory, fastlane will be used by
  calling `bundle install` then `bundle exec`.

  Otherwise the system installed `fastlane` version will be used.

        Use this option if the fastlane directory is not in your repository's root.

        Working directory should be the parent directory of your Fastfile's directory.

        Example:

        * If the Fastfile path is `./here/is/my/fastlane/Fastfile`
        * Then the Fastfile's directory is `./here/is/my/fastlane`
        * So the Working Directory should be: `./here/is/my`
